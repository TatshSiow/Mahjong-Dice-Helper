# Mahjong-Dice-Helper
Let me help you with your frustrating Mahjong dice counting!

## What is this?
As a mahjong player, it is such a headache to count dice positions and stacks\
So I made this to ease my mahjong experience

**We need to count it every single game!**

## What it does
- Initialize two sets dices (each set has 2 dices)
- First Set dices count the starting position of the game
- Second Set dices is used for sum up the first dice, setting the starting stack count
- If the stack count > 18, it will jump the stack to the next position

## Note
- The script initiate the starting position as East (Which is the starting position where you at)
- The `Stack Position` means the first stack you can take


## Sample
